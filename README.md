# pd2-spawn-simulator
Experimental PD2 map population, monster density, XP and rarity simulator.

## Patching the build

`simulator.bin` is a gzipped single-page build. The site look (stone and gold theme), the shared site nav and the
boss/entrance map markers are applied on top of an unpatched build by `patch/patch.py`:

```
python patch/patch.py              # re-patch the last unpatched build (simulator.bin at cba29b1)
python patch/patch.py new.bin      # patch a fresh build from the simulator source
```

It writes `simulator.bin` and bumps the `?v=` version in `index.html`. Every replacement must match exactly, so a
build that changed underneath it stops with an error instead of half-applying.

Boss and entrance positions come from each layout's DS1 presets. The clear route is drawn on that same map.
Spawn clear is how many of the simulated monsters the group must kill. Group size is the width of the
bar drawn around the route, and a monster inside that bar counts as killed. Walking while touching a
fresh monster takes no time. Walking beside a stretch the group has already covered is heavily penalized.
To regenerate `patch/markers.json` (needs the installed PD2 data and the map_compare tools; paths are at the
top of the script):

```
python patch/markers.py [new.bin]
```
